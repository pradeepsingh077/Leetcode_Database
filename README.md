Usage
This repository is organized into different categories of SQL challenges and solutions, such as:

* Basic Queries: Simple SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
* Joins: Solutions involving INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
* Subqueries: Writing nested queries to solve more complex problems.
* Aggregation: Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG().
* Optimization: Query tuning and performance optimization techniques using indexes, EXPLAIN, and more.
Feel free to explore the folders and examples based on what you're learning or working on.
